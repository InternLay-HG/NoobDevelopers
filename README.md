Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Skillink
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Skill Sync project is to create a platform that enables users to synchronize and enhance their skills. The platform should provide a streamlined, user-friendly interface for skill tracking and recommendation.

1.2 Scope
Skill Sync aims to bridge skill gaps by offering personalized recommendations,  and a progression tracking system. It will use machine learning (ML) models to analyze user skills and predict areas for improvement.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
VS Code: Visual Studio Code, the primary code editor for development.
Figma: Design and prototyping tool.
scikit-learn (sklearn): Machine learning library in Python.
NLP: Natural Language Processing
Seaborn: Machine learning library in python for visualisation of data, 
1.4 References
Project documentation
Libraries documentation (scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas)
1.5 Overview
This SRS outlines functional, non-functional, and technical requirements for Skillink, ensuring all stakeholders understand project expectations.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
Skill Sync will serve as a standalone application with capabilities for skill analysis, recommendation, and visualization. The user will interact with it through a web-based interface with data processed on the back end using ML models.

2.2 Product Functions
Skill Progression Tracking: Track and visualize skill improvements over time.
Recommendations: Recommend resources based on user skill gaps.
Feedback: User experience and  feedback.
2.3 Operating Environment
The platform will operate in a web environment, compatible with modern web browsers. It will be developed on VS Code and Figma for UI/UX and use scikit-learn, Seaborn for ML functionalities.

2.4 Constraints
Performance limitations due to real-time ML processing.
Security of user data.
Compatibility with multiple devices and browsers.
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
